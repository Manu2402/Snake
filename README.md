# Snake
A simple “Snake” game developed to test early programming skills learned in the first two months of the first year of the “Video Game Programming” course at AIV (Accademia Italiana dei Videogiochi). The game consists of a classic version of "Snake" implemented through the C# language and the “Aiv.Draw” educational graphics library.
The only additional functionality compared to a classic “Snake” is the presence of a shower of pixels whenever the score exceeds every 10 points (10, 20, 30...).

Commands: W, A, S, D for movement (Up, Left, Down, Right).
